Discord/Github Sync Utils

## Initialize your Account
Account Syncs are currently handled via AUTH-Tokens [(How do we use your Data?)](#privacy).  
Connect to your Account: `v!init key`. The Bot will dm you, asking for your API-Token. This is a One-time-setup.  

### Privacy
We handle your Data with great Care: Your Access Tokens will be encrypted using Python's [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) before being saved. I will never ever read your Tokens.
